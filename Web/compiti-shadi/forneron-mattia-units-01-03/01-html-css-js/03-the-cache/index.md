## Answers
### What does ?v=1.0 do? 
> The ?v=1.0 in a URL is like a tag for a specific version of a file, like a style or script. It helps ensure that when a new version is available, your browser gets the latest one instead of using an old, cached version.


### How does the browser cache work? 
> The browser cache stores copies of web files, like images or scripts, locally on your device. When you visit a website, the browser checks its cache first before downloading files again. If a file hasn't changed (based on its version or modification date), the browser uses the cached copy, speeding up page loading. Caching helps reduce server load and improves user experience by delivering content faster.
